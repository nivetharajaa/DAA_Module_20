Rat In A Maze Problem
You are given a maze in the form of a matrix of size n * n. Each cell is either clear or blocked denoted by 1 and 0 respectively. A rat sits at the top-left cell and there exists a block of cheese at the bottom-right cell. Both these cells are guaranteed to be clear. You need to find if the rat can get the cheese if it can move only in one of the two directions - down and right. It can’t move to blocked cells.

                                             

Provide the solution for the above problem Consider n=4)

The output (Solution matrix) must be 4*4 matrix with value "1" which indicates the path to destination and "0" for the cell indicating the absence of the path to destination.

Question text
You are given an integer N. For a given N x N chessboard, find a way to place 'N' queens such that no queen can attack any other queen on the chessboard.

A queen can be attacked when it lies in the same row, column, or the same diagonal as any of the other queens. You have to print one such configuration.



Note :

Get the input from the user for N . The value of N must be from 1 to 4

If solution exists Print a binary matrix as output that has 1s for the cells where queens are placed

If there is no solution to the problem  print  "Solution does not exist"

For example:

Input	Result
4
0 0 1 0 
1 0 0 0 
0 0 0 1 
0 1 0 0

Question text
Greedy coloring doesn’t always use the minimum number of colors possible to color a graph. For a graph of maximum degree x, greedy coloring will use at most x+1 color. Greedy coloring can be arbitrarily bad;

Create a python program to implement graph colouring using Greedy algorithm.

For example:

Test	Result
colorGraph(graph, n)
Color assigned to vertex 0 is BLUE
Color assigned to vertex 1 is GREEN
Color assigned to vertex 2 is BLUE
Color assigned to vertex 3 is RED
Color assigned to vertex 4 is RED
Color assigned to vertex 5 is GREEN
